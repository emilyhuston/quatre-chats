    <p>An unnamed Russian kitty has become a YouTube sensation thanks to its obsessed interest 
      with a vacuum cleaner. The enthralled feline appears to be tasting some unseen bit of 
      deliciousness on the end of the vacuum cleaner, and, as the kitty goes in for a lick, 
      the hose attaches itself to the cat’s face. Despite the apparent unprovoked attack by 
      the vacuum cleaner, the cat goes in for another taste. 
    </p>
    <p>The YouTube video titled 
      Кот и пылесос has already racked up more than 2.48 million views. Cat videos are huge 
      on YouTube, and, given the meteoric rise of this new video, it looks as if a simple cat 
      battling with a vacuum cleaner could soon become one of the most watched YouTube cat videos 
      of all time.
