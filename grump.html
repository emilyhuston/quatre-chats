      <p>Grumpy Cat (born April 4, 2012), real name Tardar Sauce, is a female cat and Internet 
        celebrity known for her grumpy facial expression. Her owner Tabatha Bundesen says that 
        her permanently grumpy-looking face is due to feline dwarfism.

        Grumpy Cat's popularity 
        originated from a picture posted to the social news website reddit by Tabatha's brother 
        Bryan on September 22, 2012. It was made into an image macro with grumpy captions. 
        "The Official Grumpy Cat" on Facebook has over 1.1 million Likes. Grumpy Cat was 
        featured on the front page of The Wall Street Journal on May 30, 2013.
